<strong>roadie log</strong> \# <sub> another post </sub>

I really like Kevin Skoglunds way of teaching. very cool. But the course I have is for <strong>Rails 4</strong> - so a little _outdated_

...it seems I can get the complete current rails course from Michael Hartl (whom I also like as a teacher, great dude) with 9 ebooks and 54 hours of video to keep forever for $441. That seems like a good deal. If another 999 students bought that He might offer it for half the price. But that would only be $220.000 ... that might not cover the costs of creating the course plus paying for the webserver etc..

_I think I will go for the 441 version together with the 148 refactoring - thats below 600 and way below 25.000 for an education._

I carried on with the old Skoglund Tut and so far it works. _ActiveRecord::Base_ seems to be <strong>ApplicationRecord</strong> now which is fine.

<h2>no biggie</h2>

Then I found that I have a nice sql mode in emacsaqua so that is cool. [Setup here](https://truongtx.me/2014/08/23/setup-emacs-as-an-sql-database-client)
