Right now I am looking at [this nice railsdev setup howto](https://lorefnon.me/2014/02/02/configuring-emacs-for-rails.html)<br /> _... that is a proper github page btw, I will have to do this here too some time_  alrighty. thats it, stay tuned ...


I just got another email from Chris ___Lets start from scratch___ and there is a reminder that <strong>Ben Ohrenstein</strong> has this course on refactoring rails code which I absolutely need, no argument there. However, I first have to write the Rails code... maybe he does not know that I am just starting out. Maybe, the db says I am already coding in Ruby and Rail and what have you and I should get on the refactoring rails code course straight away. I did not bit(e) the first time so its only fair to give me a second chance ... I could have missed the first mail. So I will make a note to get the railsCodeRefactorCourseByBen immidiamente apres learningTheRuby.
