<strong>roadie log</strong> \# <sub> ... no cookie, hope that's ok </sub>

its kind of setup now, this jekyll blog of mine hosted on github pages. I have a kbd macro for writing posts on the machine and then push the master and the site gets updated. ... something like that, very slick.

I am looking through the [jekyll showcases](https://jekyllrb.com/showcase/) and so far they look good - some are quite nice. Some have gone defunct or are frozen site relics. a few times I get  _'you are not connected to the internet'_ and only after 2 or 3 reloads the site comes into view ... weird.

now, I think there is a market (huge) for simple sites (header-nav-content-footer) that don't even have cookies. rbb - <strong>real bare bones</strong>
