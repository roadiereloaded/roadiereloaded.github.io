<strong>roadie log</strong> \# <sub> a clear mind </sub>

found a post about where jekyll came from:<br /> [blogging like a hacker ](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html)

<strong> very cool </strong>
<hr />

_nice program_ so this is 11+ years ago and I don't see anything that came along and did it better so far.
in the article is this: "coming from a graphic design background means I’ll always be tweaking the site’s appearance and layout". this 'always' is the thing. Constantly something new or changed, improved and whatnot.

jekyll it is then - hang in there and here are some more thrashtags to help this blog go viral:
