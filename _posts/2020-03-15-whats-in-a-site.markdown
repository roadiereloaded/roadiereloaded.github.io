<strong>roadie log</strong> \# <sub> bare essentials </sub>

I had a sober sip of coffee and a dry cookie and now, in my belgrade appartment I am trying to figure out what should be in a website for the individual normalsterblichen.

- a <strong>nav</strong> in the header. 3 links max - home content about _that's it_<br />
- the <strong>content</strong> with the content in <em>sections</em> if need be...<br />
- a <strong>footer</strong> with the [social share icons](https://jonsuh.com/blog/social-share-links/)

I think thats it. ...
now, what should not be in the website? ...

- a _contact form_ - it has to be a mailto thingy ...
- _javascript_ no js, can that be done? website without javascript? dunno, must research
- _cookies_ and all that stats jazz - stats are useless, we can open a youtube channel if we want stats.
- _php_ - very evil, no good.

I think that's it... yep, good start - the basics.

what if they want an image gallery? (I know I want one...) - goes in content of course. CSS only.
ecommerce - what if they want to sell stuff? - ok, they need a bank account. And they need to sell only inside their country / EU and thats it. Everyone else can wrestle with wordpress and woocommerce - its only fair. .. no pain no gain.

what else? ... what about comments, forum .... I don't know, have to read up ... laters.
