<strong>roadie log</strong> \# <sub> TIL </sub>

it seems that github is not only a blogging platform, they also host code repositories of programmers (git repos - hence the name...). Now this is a huge amount of code that is stored here along with all the blogposts and I just learned that Bill Gates bought all that code for 7plusBillion dollars last year or even earlier.

_mildly interesting_

today I am looking at more parts that will be the backbone of my revelutionary (that might actually be 'revolutionary' with an o instead of an e, just saying) static site generator. still deciding on a name for this baby. <strong>comrade</strong> would be a good choice - or <strong>'strawman'</strong> ... undecided.

<h3>... first things first</h3>
