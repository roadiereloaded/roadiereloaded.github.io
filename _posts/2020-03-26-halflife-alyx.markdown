<strong>roadie log</strong> \# <sub> pick it up </sub>

so I have gone and watched the alyx playthroughs on youtube. first time I see a VR game. I pointed at the screen a couple of times and told my wife "look at this, they are writing history here". now I know its not the first time, but it is a thing for sure.

The level design is amazing. So cool. The atmosphere and design of this 1984 steampunk, its not steampunk is it - what about that film... <em>whatsitcalled</em> ... with the rebelwoman driving that monster truck and the dude from the ministry of truth or something ... anyways - the level design in alyx is awesome.

The dialogs are a complete desaster, but I think the kids like it, otherwise they would not have done it. Terrible story ruining the whole thing. How can they? but ... who cares about what I think. irrelevant of course.

The mechanics are great, I don't have a VR set and I am not getting one but I can see that it is very slow. I would probably like that actually - the guns are fantastic but the repetition with those glowy circuits, the 3D rubic ball puzzles and the resin gathering is tiresome when you watch.

And how can it be that you have to find your ammunition in all those boxes? The combine don't have ammo on them? ok. The Jeff chapter is great - its a bit of that dude in the other film where she is supposed to get something but not eat anything from the table because it would wake the blind monster sitting there and of course she does and so on... forgot what the film is called - its about a lost princess? ...
Anyway Jeff reminded me of that and the chapter is great - really scary. Thank god I don't have to play that.

So like I said - God Tier Level design and laughable movie story ruining the whole thing. <strong> how great this game could have been </strong>

right up there with FarCry and Crysis as a potentially great game. And Valve did not even have to make money with it, I don't think. go figure.
