<strong>roadie log</strong> \# <sub>ff:a</sub>

I have to learn css before I can learn the ruby.
<code>font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;</code>

thats it. no CDN, no font folders. done. _I might add Monaco for the code fonts but also get some system font to do it, I don't care_

So this means no fontawesome and ionicons and god knows what. nada.

<strong> I think I am on to something,</strong> stay tuned.
