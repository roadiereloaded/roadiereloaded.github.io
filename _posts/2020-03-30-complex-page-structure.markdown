<strong>roadie log</strong> \# <sub> ... </sub>

<strong>header</strong>
h1 and one p and the nav - max 3 links

<strong>main</strong>
articles and sections as you see fit

<strong>footer</strong>
copyright - impressum and share links

That is it. So what should the nav be? home - content and contact? ...
if the content is the gallery or folio - how do I drill down from there while keeping home and contact? - <em>sub nav</em>? is that it?

in the book cover use case there would be some categories like thriller, scifi and horror ... etc etc ... and the ruby would supply the grid ...

<h3> I am on it </h3>
