<strong>roadie log</strong> \# <sub>  </sub>

so I got sidetracked again <em> - I know </em> but... pluralsight decided to make april a free month for all courses.

so I signed up with one of my best trash emails and found this dutch dude teaching bash scripting - excellent course, highly recommended. And I have a Rails, Ruby and something else on the list - let's see how much I can absorb in 30 days.

and then I read a little reddit and someone mentioned <strong> Alien Isolation</strong> and that they suspect the paths are hardcoded <sub>(the ones the alien takes)</sub> and so I checked and it seems they are not, nav points like crysis and a suboptimal choosing pattern maybe.
<h3>however</h3>

... the reddit thread was about games that did not live up to their hype, or something like that and I noticed that game mechanics can become a chore even if the story is great. At least that is what quite a few redditors stated. Crysis is different - the game mechanics are awesome and the story is rubbish. So the reloaded krieger story setting needs a lot of work. Needs to be as good as it gets.
