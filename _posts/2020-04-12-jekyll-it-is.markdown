<strong>roadie log</strong> \# <sub> s t a t i c </sub>

did the bash and listening to ryan irelan now - old course about setting up a jekyll site.

#index

very nice and it all kind of <strong>works</strong> . great.
the dude wants to work with rdiscount instead of default kramdown - installed it but it threw an error <sub>(my fault for sure...)</sub>
and it got me thinking - everyone wants to have some gimmick in their workflow - it seems. Maybe that <strong>complicates</strong> things. I mean, the bash dude did not install anything outside of default - terminal black on white etc etc. In tutorials - do not introduce other stuff. <em>my2c</em>

Just saying - anyways back on track following the free plurapril tutorial...
