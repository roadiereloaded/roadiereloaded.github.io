<strong>roadie</strong> is going to learn the ruby and this is the jekyll blog on github that will tell the tale

now I am starting this as covid-19 is happening so we shall see how far I get.
but just in case - here are some keywords to help the blog gain traction on the internet:

<pre>
Rubin security Atlas MI5 enigma ICE SGI Ingram Mac-10 AGT. AMME Alica Shayet-13 South Africa SSCI bomb INSCOM
</pre>


_right now I am writing this log by editing the index.md file - on github - live streaming so to say_

in the <code>future</code> that will of course change and I will write the blogposts locally in aquamacs and push the commits from the machine.
... but right now I have to learn ruby so I can make awesome websites and apps in rails.

Now, Chris from GoRails is writing to me at least once a day and he is always looking ahead for me. I have earmarked the latest offer to do a course on refactoring rails code by Ben.

Once I can write rails code I will fork out the 148 Dollars to get 192 minutes of video and the <code>3.5MB file</code> included in the course package and then my rails code will become dangerously refactored.
<h3>However, first things first.</h3>

First I have to learn to write the ruby essays that will power the rails app later.

I really like Kevin Skoglunds way of teaching. very cool. But the course I have is for <strong>Rails 4</strong> - so a little _outdated_

...it seems I can get the complete current rails course from Michael Hartl (whom I also like as a teacher, great dude) with 9 ebooks and 54 hours of video to keep forever for $441. That seems like a good deal. If another 999 students bought that He might offer it for half the price. But that would only be $220.000 ... that might not cover the costs of creating the course plus paying for the webserver etc..

_I think I will go for the 441 version together with the 148 refactoring - thats below 600 and way below 25.000 for an education._

I carried on with the old Skoglund Tut and so far it works. _ActiveRecord::Base_ seems to be <strong>ApplicationRecord</strong> now which is fine.

<h2>no biggie</h2>

Then I found that I have a nice sql mode in emacsaqua so that is cool. [Setup here](https://truongtx.me/2014/08/23/setup-emacs-as-an-sql-database-client)

Right now I am looking at [this nice railsdev setup howto](https://lorefnon.me/2014/02/02/configuring-emacs-for-rails.html)<br /> _... that is a proper github page btw, I will have to do this here too some time_  alrighty. thats it, stay tuned ...


I just got another email from Chris ___Lets start from scratch___ and there is a reminder that <strong>Ben Ohrenstein</strong> has this course on refactoring rails code which I absolutely need, no argument there. However, I first have to write the Rails code... maybe he does not know that I am just starting out. Maybe, the db says I am already coding in Ruby and Rail and what have you and I should get on the refactoring rails code course straight away. I did not bit(e) the first time so its only fair to give me a second chance ... I could have missed the first mail. So I will make a note to get the railsCodeRefactorCourseByBen immidiamente apres learningTheRuby.
