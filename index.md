roadie is going to learn the ruby and this is the jekyll blog on github that will tell the tale

now I am starting this as covid-19 is happening so we shall see how far I get.
but just in case - here are some keywords to help the blog gain traction on the internet:

<pre>
Rubin security Atlas MI5 enigma ICE SGI Ingram Mac-10 AGT. AMME Alica Shayet-13 South Africa SSCI bomb INSCOM
</pre>


_right now I am writing this log by editing the index.md file - on github - live streaming so to say_

in the <code>future</code> that will of course change and I will write the blogposts locally in aquamacs and push the commits from the machine.
