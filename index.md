<strong>roadie</strong> is going to learn the ruby and this is the jekyll blog on github that will tell the tale

now I am starting this as covid-19 is happening so we shall see how far I get.
but just in case - here are some keywords to help the blog gain traction on the internet:

<pre>
Rubin security Atlas MI5 enigma ICE SGI Ingram Mac-10 AGT. AMME Alica Shayet-13 South Africa SSCI bomb INSCOM
</pre>


_right now I am writing this log by editing the index.md file - on github - live streaming so to say_

in the <code>future</code> that will of course change and I will write the blogposts locally in aquamacs and push the commits from the machine.
... but right now I have to learn ruby so I can make awesome websites and apps in rails. 

Now, Chris from GoRails is writing to me at least once a day and he is always looking ahead for me. I have earmarked the latest offer to do a course on refactoring rails code by Ben.

Once I can write rails code I will fork out the 148 Dollars to get 192 minutes of video and the <code>3.5MB file</code> included in the course package and then my rails code will become dangerously refactored.
<h3>However, first things first.</h3>

First I have to learn to write the ruby essays that will power the rails app later.
